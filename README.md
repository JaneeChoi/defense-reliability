# defense-reliability
This repository includes multiple modeling approaches and references on military operation research. The following are our main topics.
- Impute two types of data: exists but unobserved and doesn't exist (e.g. failure of new engine type)
- Predict failure counts or period
- Schedule two types of maintenance: preventive triggered by inspection and corrective 
- Estimate or simulate rare event

## Rare event estimation and simulation techniques
- [Modelling Extremal Events estimation](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540609315) explains how to estimate the tails of distributions and Ch.6 is the most illustrative.

- [Introduction to Rare Event Simulation](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387200781) shows efficient Monte Carlo computation to estimate occurrence proabaility of rare events. [Rare-Event Simulation Techniques: An Introduction and Recent Advances (survey)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092705070613011X) introduce a shorter overview.
